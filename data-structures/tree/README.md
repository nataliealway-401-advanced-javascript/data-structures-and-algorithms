# Binary Trees



## Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
* Create a BinaryTree class
* Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
