## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

* AddNode()
  * Adds a new node to the graph
* AddEdge()
  * Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
* GetNodes()
  * Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
* GetNeighbors()
  * Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
* Size()
  * Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
* AddNode() -> O(1)
* AddEdge() -> O(1)
* GetNodes() -> O(n)
* GetNeighbors() -> O(1)
* Size() -> O(1)

## API
* AddNode() -> Adds a vertex to the graph
* AddEdge() -> Adds an edge to a vertex
* GetNodes() -> Retruns a list of all vertexes
* GetNeighbors(vertex) -> Returns all adjecent vertexes
* Size() -> Gets the numbers of vertexes in the graph
