# Linked Lista
Create a linked list, search to see if a specific value is present, and return a string of all values in the list.


## Challenge
Write tests to prove the following functionality:

* Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
* Can properly insert into the linked list
* The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
* Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
* Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
* Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
* Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
*I created a node class with the properties of 'value' and 'next' which connects to the next node, then created a linkedList class that has the head value and tracks the head that the linked list is pointing to.

*BigO -> O(n)
