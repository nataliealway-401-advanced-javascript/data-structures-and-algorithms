# Linked Lists - Kth From The End
k-th value from the end of a linked list.


## Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a method that finds the end of the link list, then counts backwards towards it
